<h1 align='center'> libpredict </h1>

A satellite orbit prediction library.

## Disclaimer

This is a fork of **[la1k/libpredict](https://github.com/la1k/libpredict/)** and is inspired by **[philcrump's](https://github.com/philcrump/libpredict/)** fork of the same library. 
See the [License](#license) section for specifics.

## Building

To build the library it should be as simple as running:

``` bash
make
```

To specify the build directory you could run:

``` bash
make BUILD_DIR=/your/build/dir/
```

To specify a custom toolchain prefix like arm toolchain , you can do as follows:

``` bash
make TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=arm-none-eabi- CC_FLAGS_APPEND="-mthumb -mcpu=cortex-m3" 
```

## Installation

```
make install
```

The install location is defined by `INSTALL_DIR`, which
defaults to `/usr/lib`. To relocate the whole installation (to make
usr/local etc. inside another directory, e.g., if you want to make a
tarball or package it afterwards), use `make INSTALL_DIR=/foo/bar install`.
